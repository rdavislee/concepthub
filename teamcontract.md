Team Contract – 6.1040
=======================

Shared Expectations
-------------------
- **Effort & grade**: We are aiming for an A in 6.1040. Each teammate plans to invest about 11 hours outside class weekly, acknowledging occasional fluctuations and communicating early if availability shifts.
- **Personal goals**: Collectively we want to sharpen software design instincts, become comfortable with Vue and the course toolchain, practice healthy collaboration habits, and deliver an app that real users find valuable.

Collaboration Cadence
---------------------
- **Meetings**: We hold two standing meetings every Wednesday and Sunday for about one hour in the MIT Student Center (remote attendance available when needed). Each meeting reviews progress since the last session and assigns the next set of tasks.
- **Communication**: Outside meetings we coordinate through an iMessage group chat and reply promptly, especially near milestones.

Quality & Workflow
------------------
- **Code & docs**: GitHub is our source of truth; Google Drive stores design notes and task trackers. We keep `main` releasable, use feature branches, and require at least one peer review per pull request (tiny fixes may merge directly). We aim for readable commits and right-sized changes.
- **Task ownership**: Tasks are broken down during meetings, assigned an owner, and given an internal target. Anyone who gets blocked or anticipates missing a deadline posts in chat early so we can swarm, reassign, or adjust scope.

Decision Making & Conflict Resolution
-------------------------------------
- **Decisions**: Day-to-day calls are handled by the task owner after quick check-ins; major design or scope choices happen by group discussion and informal consensus. If consensus stalls, we take a majority vote and move forward.
- **Issues & disagreements**: We surface concerns candidly and respectfully. Persistent conflicts escalate first within the team, then to our mentor or course staff if needed. We commit to staying communicative, reliable, and supportive throughout the project.
